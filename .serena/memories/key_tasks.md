# Key Tasks and Project Status

- **Initial Implementation Complete**: The basic structure and core functionality for the LLM TalkTable project have been implemented.
    - Files: `main.py`, `config.py`, `conversation.py`, `database.py`, `config.yaml`, `README.ja.md`, `LICENSE`, `requirements.txt`
    - Feature: Two LLMs can converse on a topic using `simonw/llm`, with logs saved to SQLite.
    - Feature: `Ctrl+C` interruption with user choice to Stop/Continue.
- **Project Structure Refactored**: Project files moved from `llm_talktable/` subdirectory to the repository root for a cleaner, more standard layout.
    - Updated documentation and internal references.
    - Git commit: `9dccb38`
- **Chat Display Features Enhanced**:
    - Added `max_turns` and `show_prompt` options in `config.yaml` for flexible conversation control.
    - Implemented colored console output for participant responses using `colorama`.
    - Added CLI option `--show-prompt` to override config file setting.
    - Conditional display of prompts and "Response:" labels based on `show_prompt` setting.
    - Replaced streaming display (type-writer effect) with a visual spinner (`yaspin`) to indicate LLM processing time.
    - Git commits: `37ed21c`, `d127dc2`, `395254d`, `4d6495d`
- **CTRL+C Handling Fixed and Enhanced**:
    - Resolved issues where `Ctrl+C` during LLM calls would cause immediate program termination.
    - Implemented robust `KeyboardInterrupt` handling that allows users to choose between continuing the current turn or stopping the entire conversation.
    - Corrected duplicate method definitions in `conversation.py` that were overriding the custom interrupt logic.
    - Git commits: `8b0490d`, `c56e77f`, `d363f10`, `2adc928`
- **External Persona Files Support Added**:
    - Integrated `yaml_include` package to enable `!include` tags in `config.yaml`.
    - This allows storing participant personas in separate files (e.g., `personas/alice_persona.txt`) for better organization.
    - Persona files were converted to valid YAML format (using literal block scalars `|`) to be compatible with `yaml_include`.
    - Git commits: `37ed21c`, `d127dc2`, `395254d`, `4d6495d`, `8b0490d`, `c56e77f`, `d363f10`, `2adc928`, `3807fad`, `e4ce1c6`, `bfca057`, `064f93a`, `77c8773`
- **Spinner Pattern Customized**:
    - Changed the visual indicator for LLM processing time from `Spinners.clock` to `Spinners.bouncingBall`.
    - Added magenta color to the spinner for better visibility.
    - Git commit: (to be added after staging and committing)
- **Code Quality Improvements (2025-08-24)**:
    - **Unified Logging**: Implemented a unified logging system using the `logging` module with colored output for better debugging and monitoring.
    - **Enhanced Type Hints**: Completed and refined type hints across `config.py`, `conversation.py`, and `database.py` for improved code clarity and static analysis.
    - **Strengthened Configuration Validation**: Added robust validation logic in `config.py` to ensure configuration file integrity and provide clear error messages for invalid settings.
    - **Refactored Exception Handling**: Simplified and consolidated exception handling in `conversation.py` to improve code readability and reduce redundancy.
    - **Optimized Database Connection Management**: Introduced a context manager in `database.py` for efficient and safe database connection handling, including proper transaction management.

- **Development Workflow Note**:
    - As of 2025-08-24, the development process has been clarified: **All features must be tested and confirmed working on their respective feature branches *before* merging into `main`**. This ensures code quality and prevents integration issues.
- **Application Testing and Verification (2025-08-30)**:
    - **Full Application Test**: Conducted comprehensive testing of the LLM TalkTable application with real LLM models (Gemini and OpenRouter).
    - **Moderator Functionality Verified**: MC successfully managed conversation flow, provided round summaries, and delivered final wrap-up.
    - **Multi-LLM Integration Confirmed**: Different LLM models (gemini/gemini-2.5-flash, openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free) worked seamlessly together.
    - **Persona System Working**: Participant personalities (Alice: energetic/bright, Karen: quiet/reserved) were clearly expressed and maintained throughout conversation.
    - **Database Logging Verified**: All conversation turns properly saved to SQLite database with correct structure (conversation_id, turn_number, speaker_name, model_used, response, timestamps).
    - **UI Features Functional**: Spinner indicators, colored output, and turn management all working as expected.
    - **Task Progress Updated**: Marked tasks 0 (directory structure) and 3 (moderator functionality) as completed in my/3task.md.
- **MC Model Change and Test Execution (2025-08-30)**:
    - Changed the LLM model used by the Moderator (MC) from `openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free` to `gemini/gemini-2.5-flash` due to an API error (400: Operation not allowed) encountered with the former model.
    - After the change, the application test execution completed successfully, and the conversation summary feature was confirmed to be working correctly.
- **Next Steps**:
    - Proceed with remaining tasks in my/3task.md: conversation summary/evaluation (task 4), turn control enhancements (task 5), testing implementation (task 6), and code review items (task 8).
