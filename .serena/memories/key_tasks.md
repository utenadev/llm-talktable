# Key Tasks and Project Status

- **Initial Implementation Complete**: The basic structure and core functionality for the LLM TalkTable project have been implemented.
    - Files: `main.py`, `config.py`, `conversation.py`, `database.py`, `config.yaml`, `README.ja.md`, `LICENSE`, `requirements.txt`
    - Feature: Two LLMs can converse on a topic using `simonw/llm`, with logs saved to SQLite.
    - Feature: `Ctrl+C` interruption with user choice to Stop/Continue.
- **Project Structure Refactored**: Project files moved from `llm_talktable/` subdirectory to the repository root for a cleaner, more standard layout.
    - Updated documentation and internal references.
    - Git commit: `9dccb38`
- **Chat Display Features Enhanced**:
    - Added `max_turns` and `show_prompt` options in `config.yaml` for flexible conversation control.
    - Implemented colored console output for participant responses using `colorama`.
    - Added CLI option `--show-prompt` to override config file setting.
    - Conditional display of prompts and "Response:" labels based on `show_prompt` setting.
    - Replaced streaming display (type-writer effect) with a visual spinner (`yaspin`) to indicate LLM processing time.
    - Git commits: `37ed21c`, `d127dc2`, `395254d`, `4d6495d`
- **Git Commits**:
    - `e80088a`: Initial commit adding the project structure and core files.
    - `9dccb38`: Refactor project structure to repository root.
    - `37ed21c`: Enhance chat display features (streaming, colors, config).
    - `d127dc2`: Update .gitignore.
    - `395254d`: Add display options and fix colored output.
    - `4d6495d`: Add waiting indicator (spinner) using yaspin.
- **Development Workflow Note**:
    - As of 2025-08-24, the development process has been clarified: **All features must be tested and confirmed working on their respective feature branches *before* merging into `main`**. This ensures code quality and prevents integration issues.
- **Next Steps**:
    - Proceed with the next development phases based on the requirements and task files in the `my/` directory.
