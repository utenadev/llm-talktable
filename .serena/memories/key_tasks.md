# Key Tasks and Project Status

- **Initial Implementation Complete**: The basic structure and core functionality for the LLM TalkTable project have been implemented.
    - Files: `main.py`, `config.py`, `conversation.py`, `database.py`, `config.yaml`, `README.ja.md`, `LICENSE`, `requirements.txt`
    - Feature: Two LLMs can converse on a topic using `simonw/llm`, with logs saved to SQLite.
    - Feature: `Ctrl+C` interruption with user choice to Stop/Continue.
- **Project Structure Refactored**: Project files moved from `llm_talktable/` subdirectory to the repository root for a cleaner, more standard layout.
    - Updated documentation and internal references.
    - Git commit: `9dccb38`
- **Chat Display Features Enhanced**:
    - Added `max_turns` and `show_prompt` options in `config.yaml` for flexible conversation control.
    - Implemented colored console output for participant responses using `colorama`.
    - Added CLI option `--show-prompt` to override config file setting.
    - Conditional display of prompts and "Response:" labels based on `show_prompt` setting.
    - Streaming display (type-writer effect) was implemented but is currently paused to correctly apply text colors.
    - Git commits: `37ed21c`, `d127dc2`, `395254d`
